Then, Here are a<strong> few unknown facts that you must be aware<\/strong> of before changing your shower head.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, shower head filters are used instead of showerheads to reduce the hardness of the water. Also, they come within a comfortable price range. <strong>But are shower head filters worth<\/strong> or total waste of money?<\/p>\n<p>It totally depends on the quality of your water. Because shower head filters can&#8217;t reduce the TDS or can change the color of the water. It only reduces the effect of salts &amp; makes the harmful contaminants harmless. So, if your household water has a very high TDS level, you can&#8217;t expect a decent result using the filters.<\/p>\n<hr>\n\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5057 size-full alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/are-shower-head-filters-worth.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/are-shower-head-filters-worth.jpg 700w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/are-shower-head-filters-worth-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<h2>So, why use a shower head filter?<\/h2>\n<p>You might be wondering why you should use a shower head filter if it can&#8217;t reduce the TDS level. In general, a <strong>higher TDS level doesn&#8217;t make the water harmful<\/strong>. But, the presence of ions like aluminum, copper, or led ions in a higher amount can lead to health risk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Usually, the elevated number of chlorine and minerals like calcium &amp; magnesium reduce the quality of the water and makes it hard.<\/strong> When you regularly take a shower in this hard water, the pores (small holes that release oil &amp; sweat ) of your skin get blocked, mainly because of the minerals. It leads to itchy, dry, and irritable skin.<\/p>\n<p>Also, your hair scalp fails to absorb moisturizer due to the formation of salt, which lefts on your scalp. Apart from that, <strong>these minerals make your shampoo or soap ineffective.<\/strong> So, your hair becomes dry &amp; thin and gradually develop issues like hair falling or dandruff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A water softener can fix these problems more effectively. But you prefer using a shower head filter though they are less effective. <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Because shower filters are easily available, do their work effectively. <\/span>Also, the showerhead filters are inexpensive than water softeners. Besides, the maintenance cost of a filter is very affordable.<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>how do shower head filters work?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>All of the shower filters mainly uses KDF 55 technology to filter hard water<\/strong>. However, the number of filtration stages may not be the same for the different shower filter brands.<\/p>\n<p>You can easily find a shower filter having a 16-stage filtration technique. The extra layers reduce the effect of impurities up to a significant amount &amp; provide you smooth water.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5112 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/redox-reduction.jpg\" alt=\"Best Shower Head Filter for Hard Water\" width=\"561\" height=\"248\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/redox-reduction.jpg 561w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/redox-reduction-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/best-shower-head-filter-for-hard-water-india-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Check the best shower head filters for hard water&nbsp;<\/em><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>But what is the KDF technology? The Kinetic Degradation Fluxion is the finest process of reducing chlorine and other harmful contaminants from water with the help of KDF-55 granules.<\/p>\n<p>The KDF-55 granules are basically high-purity copper-zinc granules that use oxidation\/reduction (redox) reaction during the process, remove or reduce the soluble heavy metals, minerals, and other contaminants.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, it also stops the growth of bacteria, algae, and fungi.<\/p>\n<p>Coming to the point, that how does a shower filter reduce the hardness of the water using KDF technology. As I mentioned before that the KDF is a redox reaction process, the KDF media starts exchanging electrons with the harmful contaminants as soon as come into contact with hard water.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Chlorine Removal:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The KDF-55 media inside a shower head filter cartridge can remove over 99% of free chlorine through the reduction process. In this process, the harmful chlorine gas is converted to soluble chloride Ions. However, it can&#8217;t reduce the chloramine fluoride ions significantly. So, again the water goes through a Vitamin C layer, making it safe to use.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Iron Removal:<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The KDF-85 media works as a catalyst to remove Iron from hard water. Through the redox process, the soluble ferrous ( Fe2+) cations are converted into insoluble ferric hydroxide. Afterward, the ions are easily removed by the filter through backwashing. However, backwashing is not possible in these shower filters.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Controls growth of microorganisms:<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The KDF media also extends the life of your shower filter by shutting down the growth of the microorganisms. It kills bacteria through the direct redox process of copper &amp; zinc or by rapid formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. The radicals are also formed due to the redox reaction, which forms around a 300mV charge.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Do shower head filters really work?<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yes. The showerhead filters work for which purpose they are made.&nbsp;<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can notice decent changes in your skin, hair, clothes, or other utensils after changing your shower head.&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But it takes an average of four weeks to see the changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, shower head filters do have their limitations. They can\u2019t remove organic chemicals such as pesticides, disinfection byproducts, parasitic cysts of giardia, or cryptosporidium, Because they need regular backwashing to remove these contaminants, which is very expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nevertheless, the above contaminants are generally not found in the household water. But I\u2019ll suggest you check the water condition once before purchasing a shower head filter for your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>How long do shower filters last?<\/h2>\n<p>The lifespan of the cartridge of a shower filter depends on the quality of the water. <strong>If the water is too cloudy, then obviously you need to change the cartridge more often.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The average lifespan of a cartridge ranges between 5-6 points on average. However, the water taking capability may be different for different products like 40000tr-60000ltr or even more.<\/p>\n<p>The cartridges are easily available and only cost half on the shower filter. So, don&#8217;t think that you need to change the whole shower filter. You&#8217;ve to just replace the old cartridge with a new one.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/best-ip-cameras-for-indoor\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1.
