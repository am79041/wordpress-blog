What is a Humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>In general, Humidifier is an electronic device used to increase the humidity to a particular level of your room. These kinds of humidifiers are also known as personal humidifiers.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than these personal humidifiers, a few large humidifiers are used in industries, institutions, or even in an HVAC(heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system.<\/p>\n<p>The first Humidifier was invented In 1926 by Max Katzman, founder of Kaz USA, Inc. Actually, it was an electric vaporizer, usually releasing steam &amp; moisture into the air. However, the heating process was not convenient in these systems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/best-selling-humidifiers-to-moisture-you-room-air\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Humidifiers To Moisture Room Air<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But nowadays, we generally use ultrasonic humidifiers for home or office usages. The new ultrasonic humidifiers bring plenty of features like mist control, noiseless, auto shut-off, and more. They use ultrasonic waves to create the finest mist and quietly release it to a large area.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, these are one of the most environment-friendly humidifiers at all.<\/p>\n<h3>2. When should you use a humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>The best time to use a humidifier is on winter nights when the air is dry and the humidity level is also low. In this situation, using a warm mist humidifier is preferable, makes your room temperature cozy.<\/p>\n<p>However, In cold weather, the humidity level can be higher, giving you a more chilly effect than the temperature.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Warm mist or Cool Mist &#8211; which one should you buy?<\/h3>\n<p>Both the Warm mist or Cool Mist humidifiers have the advantage and drawbacks. Let\u2019s go through their basic differences.<\/p>\n<h4>Warm Mist Humidifiers:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Good for flu or cold.<\/li>\n<li>No fan included.<\/li>\n<li>It makes less noise.<\/li>\n<li>Better hygiene.<\/li>\n<li>Not for babies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Cool Mist Humidifiers:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Best for babies.<\/li>\n<li>Use less electricity.<\/li>\n<li>Covers more space.<\/li>\n<li>Less expensive.<\/li>\n<li>Noisy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Is it good to sleep with a humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>Of Course, you can sleep with a humidifier without any issues. In fact, there are a few health benefits of sleeping with a humidifier.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a cold or flu, using a warm mist humidifier will help you to recover faster. Besides, it can heal irritated sinus passages, cracked lips, and itchy skin. Moreover, the humidifiers also save your wooden furniture from unknown damages.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Does a humidifier cool the room?<\/h3>\n<p>First &amp; foremost, cool mist humidifiers click in our minds when thinking about cooling the room. But do they really lower your room temperature?<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the basics. Our body is an auto cooling system. It always tries to keep our body cool by evaporating sweat in the form of water &amp; salt.<\/p>\n<p>But the rate of evaporation depends on the humid level of the air. On humid days, basically in summer, the air gets filled with water, which lowers the evaporation rates. So, we feel sticky and warm.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, on dry days, the sweat evaporates faster as less water is present in the air.<\/p>\n<p>The sole function of a humidifier is to increase the humidity. So, from the basics, we can say that a humidifier doesn&#8217;t make your room cooler. In fact, you\u2019ll feel slightly warmer as humidity gets uplifted.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Where should I place my humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>The best place for a personal humidifier is near your bed. Throughout the night, it\u2019ll moisturize your room and cure your nasal system of dryness. So, you\u2019ll get a sound sleep without snoring.<\/p>\n<p>However, a few things you should follow while placing a humidifier inside your room &#8211;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never place a humidifier on a floor. Otherwise, there will be fewer chances that the mist will mix up with the air. So, put the humidifier on the top of the table, having decent height.<\/li>\n<li>Be sure that the table is dry &amp; clean. Remove if there are any carpets on the table.<\/li>\n<li>Also, don&#8217;t place a humidifier close to photos.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For a baby&#8217;s room, you need to be more careful while using a humidifier. Say Completely \u201cNo\u201d to the Warm mist humidifiers for the baby&#8217;s room. They can burn the sensitive skin of your baby.<\/p>\n<p>So, for the babies, cool mist humidifiers are the ideal choice. But you should place them far from your babies.<\/p>\n<p>Further, if you also need a humidifier in your office, place it straight on the desk. But make sure it makes less noise.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Should I close my bedroom door when using a humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>Keeping the bedroom door closed is safe if you\u2019re keeping your eyes on the humidity level.<\/p>\n<p>For the small humidifiers, it\u2019s fine to close the door if your bedroom is spacious. But if you\u2019ve got a large humidifier compared to the room size, then you\u2019re advised to open the door to free some humidity.<\/p>\n<p>However, a few models do have auto-control features, which can usually increase or decrease the mist level according to the current humidity.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Is it bad to use tap water in a humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>Always try to use distilled water to fill up your humidifier\u2019s tank. Otherwise, the mist that consists of harmful bacteria can affect you &amp; your baby\u2019s health. So, it\u2019s not a good idea to use tap water in a humidifier.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, hard water amplifies the growth of scales &amp; microorganisms inside the reservoir.<\/p>\n<h3>9. How often do I clean my humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>You should clean your humidifier at least once a week. Besides, do change the water every three days, especially in the cool mist humidifiers. There are more chances of growing molds and bacteria inside the tank of cool mist humidifiers.<\/p>\n<p>Without proper cleaning, humidifiers can spread respiratory infections through their water mist.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Is Humidifier really needed in India?<\/h3>\n<p>It depends on the particular area you\u2019re living. If you\u2019re living in the south of India, then humidifiers might not be necessary at all. However, northern people will need humidifiers on certain days.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Humidifiers are one of the essential items that we must include in our home.
