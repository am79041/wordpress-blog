Burn incense<\/h2>\n<p>Burning incense inside your home is probably one of the best ideas to diminish the negative energy. <strong>Almost in every Indian household, people use to burn incense in the morning and the evening.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/burning-incense.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/burning-incense.jpg 700w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/burning-incense-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Besides, most cultures like Hinduism or Buddhism have a ritual of using incense on new beginnings.

Lucky Bamboo Plant<\/h2>\n<p>You might be heard of <strong>feng shui, a pseudoscientific practice of ancient China to heal people using energy forces<\/strong>. The <strong>tradition of keeping the bamboo plant at the house is originated from there.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5408 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/lucky-bamboo-plan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/lucky-bamboo-plan.jpg 700w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/lucky-bamboo-plan-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A Bamboo plant is considered one of the luckiest elements in feng shui. When it grows at home, your prosperity and abundance also started to expand along with the lucky plant.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from that, the number of stalks of a bamboo tree indicates specific meanings in your life.<\/p>\n<ul id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-14\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html\">\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Two stalks for Marital Life.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Three stalks for Happiness.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Five stalks for Health.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Eight stalks for Wealth and Abundance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nine stalks for Good Luck.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Ten stalks for good health, joy, happiness, and prosperity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most importantly, you should place the bamboo plant in the east or southeast direction inside your home to get the most benefit.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>3. Mount a Horseshoe<\/h2>\n<p>Especially in India, people use to mount horseshoe on their gates. <strong>It may be blind faith, but people believe that horseshoe brings good fortune in our life.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Vedic astrology,<strong> the horseshoe is also considered a lucky symbol<\/strong>. Mainly, it protects your house from all kinds of negative energies.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5414 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/horseshoe.jpg\" alt=\"Things That Bring Good Luck In The House\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/horseshoe.jpg 700w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/horseshoe-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Besides, It reduces the adverse effect of &#8220;Shani&#8217;s Drishti&#8221; or Saturn&#8217;s evil eye.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason,<strong> people are also advised to wear a horseshoe ring on their middle finger during the Sade Sati period of Saturn.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To bring the flow of good luck inside the house,<strong> you must have to hang the horseshoe in a &#8216;U&#8217; shape on the upper side of your main door.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, hanging the horseshoe in a<strong> reverse position can flush out good luck from your house. <\/strong>Also, never hang a horseshoe on a metal gate. Always <strong>keep it on a wooden gate or mount<\/strong> <strong>it on the wall above the door.<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>4. Keep a Turtle<\/h2>\n<p>Keeping a turtle at home also can bring good luck for you. But here, <strong>I&#8217;m not talking about the living creatures and, no one should convey them inside the house forcefully.<\/strong> Instead, you can keep a black turtle sculpture in your home.<\/p>\n<p>In Feng shui practice, <strong>a tortoise or turtle is one of the animal symbols that signify luck.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5423 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/lucky-turtle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/lucky-turtle.jpg 700w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/lucky-turtle-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>According to the ancient Chinese tradition, <strong>a black tortoise or turtle is one of the four celestial animals, indicate the four directions of our compass.<\/strong> Usually, the black turtle or tortoise holds the north direction representing winter.<\/p>\n<p>It <strong>provides strong protection against negative vibes and maintains stability at your home. <\/strong>Keeping a turtle in the backyard of the house can make you feel energetic the whole day.<\/p>\n<p>Like the other feng shui or Vastu practices, it also has some recommendations for better results:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Metal Tortoise<\/strong>: A metal tortoise is mainly used to<strong> increase concentration power. The best place for a metal tortoise is your office or kid&#8217;s room.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll increase your productivity for sure while kept in the<strong> north or northwest direction<\/strong>. Besides, it also helps your kids to score better in the exam by sharpening their minds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Wooden Tortoise: <\/strong>Conversely, if you have a wooden tortoise at your house, then<strong> make sure to place it in the east or southeast corner.<\/strong> It&#8217;ll remove all the negative energies from your home and fill it with happiness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In addition to these, people also like to use a female tortoise for peace in the family.<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>5. Water Fountain or Paintings<\/h2>\n<p>Flowing water s<strong>ymbolizes the uninterrupted progress<\/strong> in our life, Like a river, <strong>determines to reach its destinations instead of the obstacles like mount, plateaus, and land in its path.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5426 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/water-fountains.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/water-fountains.jpg 650w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/water-fountains-300x233.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, <strong>keeping a water fountain in your home is always preferred to attract good luck<\/strong>. It continues the flow of<strong> money, positivity, and love in your house.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>However, if you can&#8217;t make space for a water fountain at the house, use paintings depicting water flow. You&#8217;ll see the same results.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Places to keep the water fountain:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">North direction for betterment in career.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">East direction for good health.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Place in the Southeast direction to attract prosperity.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To avoid adverse effects, <strong>never use two fountains or don&#8217;t place them inside your bedroom.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>6. The Laughing Buddha<\/h2>\n<p>You may have noticed this Statue in plenty of restaurants and might be thinking of it as a decoration item. But the Statue has a different reason to be there.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5428 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/best2buy.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/laughing-buddha.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/laughing-buddha.jpg 650w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/laughing-buddha-300x231.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The figure which I&#8217;m talking about is not only the but <strong>the Laughing Buddha. He is believed to be the incarnation of Lord Buddha lived in the 10th century in ancient China.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mainly, the <strong>Laughing Buddha symbol is used in restaurants to attract wealth &amp; prosperity.<\/strong> But it also brings positive energy and blessing.<\/p>\n<p>A Laughing Buddha <strong>placed at the front door of your house always fills you with a lot of positivity and joy<\/strong> whenever you come from outside.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But never keep the Statue on the floor, bedroom, or bathroom.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Apart, keeping a bigger statue of Laughing Buddha is always favorable, as you can rub his belly to get more and more good luck.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>7.
